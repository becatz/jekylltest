title: Figuring Out Jekyll
layout: default

For someone who is trying Jekyll for the first time:
* At first I thought I had to install jekyll gem, but further reading suggested that I can just git push the raw markdown to github and github will process the markdown.
* I was afraid to git push too many changes. Then I remember that I can git push --force a clean repo :)
* Github said that github pages refresh rate is 10 minutes per refresh. This is not true. As soon as I commit changes, I can immediately see my changes when refreshing my browser.
