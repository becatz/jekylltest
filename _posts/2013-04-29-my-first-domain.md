Just bought a domain for the blog from namecheap. Before that I found an article about [how a domain registrar can cheat its customers](http://www.domainwarning.com/).

I chose to use the free DNS hosting from namecheap. Then spent some time to figure out how to set DNS host record, figuring out the meaning of 'A' record and 'CNAME', etc.

And finally, behold: http://endycahyono.com, my first domain!
