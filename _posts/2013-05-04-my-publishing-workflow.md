I put this website on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). To create a new post, first I create a new text file in [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) format. Then I commit this text file to a local [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository. Then I push the changes to GitHub. Then GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to rerender the whole site into plain HTML files.
