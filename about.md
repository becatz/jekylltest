### About This Website

Here you can find my writings and some stuff that I have built. I write here mostly about software development issues, but not always.

I try to keep each post focused on one topic, and I tend to update old posts instead of creating a new one with the same topic.

I would like to thank [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for hosting this website and [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/) for hosting the images. If you are interested to see how I set up my publishing workflow for this website, I have written [a post about it]({% post_url 2013-05-04-my-publishing-workflow %}).

My name is Endy Tjahjono. I am someone who loves to tinker with computers. I work as a software developer. In my spare time I love to play with my son and fiddling with my ipad, sometimes at the same time.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/endy_tj).

I posted a lot of questions and a few answers on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/196451/endy-tjahjono) and the other stackexchange sites.
