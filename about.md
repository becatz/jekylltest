## {{page.title}}

This website is about me, Endy Tjahjono. Here you can find my writings and some stuff that I have built. I write here mostly about software development issues, but not always.

As for myself, I am someone who loves to tinker with computers. I work as a software developer. In my spare time I love to play with my son and fiddling with my ipad, often at the same time.

I hope you enjoy the site. Happy reading!
